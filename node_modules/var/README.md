Usage
======

Use strongly typed environment variables like a boss:

    npm install var

Then create a file named `env.json` in your root folder, or if you want a different path for your configuration file, you can set it via the `ENV_VAR_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.

Your configuration contains default values and simple validation rules for your environment variables. **Any environment variables defined prior to reading `env.json` will take precedence**, but will be converted and validated according to the corresponding type defined in `env.json`.

Finally, require the package, assign it to a variable and use that instead of `process.env`:

    var env = require('var');

**Any variables that aren't defined in process.env will receive the raw, unparsed value from `env.json`**. This allows you, among other things, to set node-specific variables like `NODE_ENV` (useful in `Express`) or `TZ` from `env.json`.

**Warning:** `process.env` can only hold string values. That's the main reason this package exists.

**Warning:** some Node hosting providers don't support using spaces in environment variables through their web interface. You are free to use spaces in `env.json` though.

Supported types
===============

- string
- number
- boolean
- date
- object (including arrays)
- function

Configuration
===============

Strings
-------

You should define default values for Node environment variables first in case you want to reference them later in your configuration:

    {
      "NODE_ENV": "development",
      "TZ": "UTC",
      ...
    }

Numbers
-------

Just slap some numbers:

      "port": 3000

That was still a default value, shorthand for:

      "pageSize": {
        "default": 10
      }

Or if you want to be somewhat cryptic:

      "aspectRatio": {
        "type": "number",
        "default": "1.618"
      }

But you don't need to to that, floats are parsed just fine without the quotes and type specification.

What if you don't want a default value, just a strongly typed setting you can depend on:

      "limit": {
        "type": "number"
      }

Unless you set the `required` setting to true, the presence of the variable is optional.

Boolean
-------

It's as simple as that:

      "gzip": true

But even if you set it to the string `"false"` in your server configuration, the type will still be inferred from the `env.json` settings, so `env.gzip` would evaluate to the boolean `false`, not to the string `"false"`.

Dates
-----

Use anything that returns a valid date after being called with new Date():

      "minDate": {
        "type": "date",
        "default": "1899-12-31"
      }

Objects and Arrays
-----

You can have complex object hierarchies in your configuration:

      "log": {
        "production": {
          "console": "error",
          "loggly": ["info", "error"],
          "mail": "alert"
        },
        "default": {
          "console": ["info", "error"],
          "loggly": ["info", "error"],
          "mail": ["error", "alert"]
        }
      }

Functions
-------

Let's try something even more advanced:

      "maxSessionLength": {
        "type": "function",
        "default": "60 * 60 * 1000"
      }

Or why not be a bit more dynamic:

      "maxExtendedSessionLength": {
        "type": "function",
        "default": "30 * 24 * this.maxSessionLength"
      }

Yes, `this` refers to all environment variables that have already been parsed, so order is important.

Your function can contain anything, but bear in mind that the string is evaluated and immediately returned to save you some writing in the most common use cases. However, if you need to do some complex calculation, you still can by using an in-place function:

      "today": {
        "type": "function",
        "default": "(function () { var now = new Date(); return new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth(), now.getDate()) }())"
      },

**Warning:** Functions aren't strongly typed, so they can return values of different types.

Enviroments
-----------

But what about different environments:

      "sessionSecret": {
        "development": "not so secret",
        "required": true
      }

Your session encryption algorithm would fail if you didn't pass a valid value to it. This sets a default value in development, but throws an error if `sessionSecret` is not defined in other environments.

You can use anything as an environment name, except `type`, `default` and `required`:

      "logLevel": {
        "development": 3,
        "test": 2,
        "staging": 1,
        "production": 1,
        "default": 0
      }
